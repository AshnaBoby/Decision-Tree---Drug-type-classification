# Decision-Tree---Drug-type-classification
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict drug types based on patient attributes. It preprocesses data, splits it into training and testing sets, fits the model, predicts outcomes, and evaluates accuracy via confusion matrix and heatmap visualization.
